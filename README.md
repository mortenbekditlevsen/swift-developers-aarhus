# Swift Developer Community in Aarhus

Are you a Swift enthusiast in the vicinity of Aarhus? Join us for an occasional after-hours meetup to discuss all things Swift, including:

* Swift Evolution
* Server-side Swift
* SwiftUI
* Swift WebAssembly
* Swift Concurrency
* Distributed Actors in Swift
* Cross-platform Swift
* The Composable Architecture
* Swift Package Manager
* ...and more!

Meetups could take the form of presentations, workshops, or any other format we feel like exploring.

### About me
My name is Morten, and I'm a huge fan of the Swift programming language and its emphasis on safety and readability. While I get plenty of exposure to the language at work, I miss being part of a community where we can geek out about Swift and share our experiences with its various features and use cases.

My workplace in Skanderborg has offered to let us use our offices for a meetup, but if someone has access to a place in Aarhus, perhaps holding the meetup in Aarhus would make it more accessible to more people. 

### Feedback
If you're interested in joining the Swift meetup, I'd love to hear from you! Please let me know:

1. Would you like to join an occasional 2-3 hour session to talk about Swift?
2. Would you be able to join a meeting if it was held in Skanderborg?
3. Would you be able to join a meeting if it was held in Aarhus?
4. Would you be able to provide a location for a meeting in Aarhus? 
5. Which Swift topics would you be interested in hearing about?
6. Do you have any topics that you would like to share with others?

If you reply on behalf of yourself and some of your colleagues, please let me know how many people you represent.

Once I've collected feedback, I'll try to arrange a meetup if there's enough interest.

Please email me at [morten+swift-meetup@bekditlevsen.dk]().

I'm excited to hear from you all! :-)
